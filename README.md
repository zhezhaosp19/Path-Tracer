In this project, I build a renderer that uses ray tracing to render images simulating physical lighting in the reality. I accelerate the renderer largely by implementing Bounding Volume Hierarchy and simulate direct illuminance (including uniform hemisphere sampling and importance sampling) and indirect illuminance based on the bounces of radiance. I learn a lot how the ray tracing works and how lighting working to render a good and real image.
